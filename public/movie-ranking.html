    <h1>The Best Movies According to JezZz</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 Movies AT</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>
        one of the best sci fi movie ever , from exploring a new planets ,physics and time bending theories and a pretty good ending
    </p>
    <h3>Shutter Island</h3>
    <p>
        Again! what a mind bending movie didn't expect that to happen.Leo just nailed it .The setting and the story telling everuthing was great , immersive too
    </p>
    <h3>Dune </h3>
    <p>
        Actually this have a sequel Dune part 2 . But yeah ..the story and the setting new planet and a time that is far into the future. <br />
        One cool fact I found out was that you find that the story happens in future.. but you will not see any computers because it is said that the civilization has entered a war with ai machine and emerged victorious.. how cool is that.
